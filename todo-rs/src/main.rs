Line 18-31: Set up the database connection pool
- a pool is a managed set of db connections that can be reused instead of opening a new connection each time one is needed
      pros:
            - efficiency
                  - opening and closing db connections is expensive in terms of time and resources
                  - a pool keeps connections open and allows multiple requests to reuse them
            - concurrency
                  - multiple requests can use connections from the pool instead of waiting for new connections to be created
            - resource management
                  - the pool limits the maximum number of connections to prevent overwhelming the database.
- flow:
      1. the application starts, the pool creates a set number of connections
      2. when the request needs a db connection, it gets one from the pool
      3. after the request is complete, the connection is returned to the pool instead of being closed
      4. if no connections are available, the request waits until one is free or a new one is created

- analogy:
      - Think of a database connection pool like a taxi stand:
            - Instead of calling for a new taxi every time, passengers take taxis from a fixed pool.
            - When a taxi drops off a passenger, it returns to the stand for the next person.
            - If no taxis are available, new ones can be added, but thereâ€™s a limit.

r2d2 (short for "Reliable Redis Database Pool" but now generalized) is a connection pool manager for Rust. It helps manage a set of database connections efficiently, preventing the overhead of opening and closing connections frequently.
